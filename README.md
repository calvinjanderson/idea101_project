## Machine Learning

Around 2010, developers at Google began work on machine learning systems using neural networks. First as a proprietary application, called DistBelief, for internal use at google, the was code refined and became the foundation for a library known as TensorFlow.

Initially released on November 9, 2015, TensorFlow is an open source library of machine learning software. Often referred to  interchangeably - or frequently in conjunction - with the phrase "Artificial Intelligence," Machine Learning is the study of the use of algorithms and statistical models with computer programs. Machine Learning technology is applicable in a broad scope of computer systems because, in essence, it allows the computer to conduct decision and prediction making tasks without explicit instruction.

Machine learning algorithms are able to analyze sample data and build models in response. As a result, the computer learns to look for patterns in the training data and is subsequently able to make predictions.
